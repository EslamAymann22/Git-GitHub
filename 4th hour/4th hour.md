 ## pranching

 * to make a new branch we use "git branch >branch name < "
 * to show all branches in your repo use "git branch"
 *       and the branch than has '*' behind it is a curent branch 
 
 * to move to another brach we use "git switch >branch name < "
 * to delete specific branch use "git branch -d >branch name < "
 * to merge 2 braches first go to the merged bracnh (that i will add it ) and use 
 *   "git merge >branch name <" but !!!!!  -->  the conflict make some issue so use the       combiler to fix conflict

 * to down a specific pranch and !! don't merge it we use "fetch >branch name < "
 * to down a specific pranch and !!  merge it we use "pull >branch name < "
