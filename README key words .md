# tools 

we use "git add ." --> to add all file and changes to staging tree <br> 
~   ~  "git cinfig --list" to know data of user <br>
~   ~  "git mkdir >name of folder<" to make new folder <br>
~   ~  "git inti" to make folder to repo<br>
~   ~  "git status" to know status of files in my repo<br>
~   ~  "ls "to show content in working tree   <br>
~   ~  "git ls-files "to show content in staging(index) tree   <br>
        =>> use -s to show with size <br>
        =>> use -t to show with type <br>
        =>> use -p to show with content <br>
        another things in the git help <br>

we can use "git status -s"==> is more simple<br>
we use "git commit -m ">message<" " to commit files from staging to git with message <br>

how to know the difirace between woring tree and staging tree  <br>
by "git diff"<br>

and when get diff between staging and repo
we use "git diff --staged"

to show the diff in one step use ==> <br>
"git show >first 5 char from cha of commit< " we can get cha form "git log" <br>
